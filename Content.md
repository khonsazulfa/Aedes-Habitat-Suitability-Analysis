# Background of Study
Brazil is the biggest country in South America, with an area of 8,512,000 km2. The country has a 214 million population and most of them live in urban areas. Currently, there are a total of 4140 municipalities in Brazil (World Population Review, 2021). In 2016, Brazil experienced 802,249 suspected cases of dengue fever, 63,810 conﬁrmed cases of chikungunya, and 64,311 conﬁrmed cases of Zika fever in 1840 municipalities (MS, 2019).  Dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika are primarily caused by Arboviruses which is due to the spread of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albocpitus mosquitos (Kyle and Harris, 2008; Paupy et al., 2010). Higher infestation levels of Aedes in Brazil is related with highly populated neighborhoods and tropical weather in which increase proliferation of potential mosquitos’ breeding sites (Tauil 2001, Luz et al. 2003).  The weather of Brazil is tropical and this is suitable for the dissemination of zoonosis caused by arthropod-borne viruses (Figueiredo, 2003).

To prepare the country for the re-emergence of the diseases, it is crucial to understand the historical distribution of Aedes occurrences and measuring the potential risk that might be established based on habitat suitability variables. Therefore, this study aims to map and model Aedes habitat suitability through the following objectives: (1) map the risk based on historical Aedes mosquitos occurrences, (2) map the environmental suitability variables and (3) develop relationship model to know how habitat suitability variables influence Aedes mosquitos occurrences. The structure of this study starts with background of problem and previous study of habitat suitability variables. The methodology used and the result of the objectives will be explained in the following part. Afterward, we will discuss the high suitability area in Brazil for Aedes based on relationship model and previous scientific evidence. In the last part, there are conclusion which sum up the finding of the study.

# Habitat Suitability Variables of Aedes Mosquitos
Several authors have shown that urbanization and vegetation index  have significant influence on the occurrences of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Honório et al., 2009; Lorenz, Castro, et al., 2020). While, Aedes aegypti is more prevalent in highly urbanized and densely populated neighborhoods, Aedes albopictus is more prevalent in rural, suburban, and forested urban areas. According to (Dickens et al., 2018) high population density has performed strong positive correlation with the habitat suitability of Aedes.  Socioeconomic factor such as population density, house characteristic,  and household income level were also found to play a signiﬁcant role in predicting Aedes presence and abundance (Sallam et al., 2017).

In addition, previous models highlighted the influence of climate variables in predicting the global and regional distribution of both vectors, such as temperature and precipitation. (Kreamer et al., 2015a). Temperatures between 20°C and 31°C could improve the metabolic rate of mosquitoes, which leads to increased mosquito abundance when larval habitats become available (Scott et al., 2000; Araujo et al., 2015; Misslin et al., 2016; Murdock et al., 2017). Precipitation affects in increased numbers of outdoor rain-ﬁlled containers such as tires, drums and buckets (Sallam et al., 2017), where female Aedes mosquitoes usually place their eggs on those spots and remains for several days (Service 1992; Focks and Chadee, 1997; Gubler, 1998; Calderón-Arguedas et al., 2004). However, up until recently, there is no exact amount of suitable precipitation for Aedes habitat mentioned in the related studies.

# Data Collection
The global occurrences of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have been compiled and published by Kraemer et al. (2015b). These previous publications provide data on the known global occurrences of Aedes between 1960 and 2014. The dataset stores 19.930 spatially unique occurrence records for Aedes aegypti and 22.137 for Aedes albopictus. 

In this study, the author used average 1 kilometer squared of gridded-cell precipitation and temperature data in December from 1970 until 2000. The data were taken from WolrdClim.org version 2.1. December data for climate variable is chosen since it is the peak period of Aedes infestation (Lorenz, Castro, et al., 2020; Lorenz, Chiaravalloti-Neto, et al., 2020; Lubinda et al., 2019). In addition, this study also used world population density per grid-cell data from WorldPop.org with 1 kilometer resolution.

# Data Analysis
This study used ArcMap version 10.3 to do mapping of Aedes occurrences and habitat suitability variables. To know the categorical level of the Aedes occurrences and habitat suitability variables, the author used quantities classification tool. The classification tool used is natural breaks for three categories. Since the variables (temperature, precipitation and population density) are in raster form, the author did some data processing first before going into classification. Firstly, the author did Extract by Mask, to clip the variables (precipitation, temperature and population density) into the Brazil boundary. Secondly, the author used Statistic as Table, to clip the variables data from in Brazil scale into municipalities boundary. The value of each municipality was calculated from the sum of the values in each grids divided by number of grids in one municipality. Aside of getting the spatial data in municipality level for each variable, this tool also provided the attribute table for each variables and each municipalities that can be used for the next analysis (regression model). For the mosquitos occurrences data, the author used Spatial Joint Analysis to clip the points of geolocation into municipality level. After that, the mosquitos data was classified with the same methodology as the other variables.

Finally, this study use R studio to do Pearson’s r correlation and multivariable linear regression analysis to know how much precipitation, temperature and population density affects the occurrence of mosquitos. Pearson’s r correlation aims to know whether there is relationship between two scale variables and to measure how strong the relationship (Healey, 2010). The author used linear regression since some previous studies (Ibáñez-Justicia et al., 2020; Omar et al., 2021; Proestos et al., 2015; Wilke et al., 2020) show that habitat suitability variables have linear relationship to Aedes occurrences. Before doing correlation and regression, the author run normality test as the both correlation and regression are parametric methods (Healey, 2010). However, if the data is not normally distributed, the data transformation would be run using square root or log. This study assigned Aedes occurrences as dependent variables while other variables are the independent variables. In the discussion part, the study performs the high suitability municipalities according to the result and literature review.
