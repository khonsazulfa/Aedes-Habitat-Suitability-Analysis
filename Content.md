This study used ArcMap version 10.3 to do mapping of Aedes occurrences and habitat suitability variables. To know the categorical level of the Aedes occurrences and habitat suitability variables, the author used quantities classification tool. The classification tool used is natural breaks for three categories. Since the variables (temperature, precipitation and population density) are in raster form, the author did some data processing first before going into classification. Firstly, the author did Extract by Mask, to clip the variables (precipitation, temperature and population density) into the Brazil boundary. Secondly, the author used Statistic as Table, to clip the variables data from in Brazil scale into municipalities boundary. The value of each municipality was calculated from the sum of the values in each grids divided by number of grids in one municipality. Aside of getting the spatial data in municipality level for each variable, this tool also provided the attribute table for each variables and each municipalities that can be used for the next analysis (regression model). For the mosquitos occurrences data, the author used Spatial Joint Analysis to clip the points of geolocation into municipality level. After that, the mosquitos data was classified with the same methodology as the other variables.

Finally, this study use R studio to do Pearson’s r correlation and multivariable linear regression analysis to know how much precipitation, temperature and population density affects the occurrence of mosquitos. Pearson’s r correlation aims to know whether there is relationship between two scale variables and to measure how strong the relationship (Healey, 2010). The author used linear regression since some previous studies (Ibáñez-Justicia et al., 2020; Omar et al., 2021; Proestos et al., 2015; Wilke et al., 2020) show that habitat suitability variables have linear relationship to Aedes occurrences. Before doing correlation and regression, the author run normality test as the both correlation and regression are parametric methods (Healey, 2010). However, if the data is not normally distributed, the data transformation would be run using square root or log. This study assigned Aedes occurrences as dependent variables while other variables are the independent variables. In the discussion part, the study performs the high suitability municipalities according to the result and literature review. The illustration on research methodology is shown in Figure 1.
